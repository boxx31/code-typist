Summary:
Temporary title: "Code Typist"
Exercises: printing, variables, if-statements, loops, user input, arrays, classes
Modes: guided, time challenge, free mode, debugging
User actions: (Select exercise) > (Select mode ["guided" default]) > (Type & debug & run) > (Switch mode)

Further description of modes:
In the debugging 
mode the user gets a similar program in which they must fix 
the error. (This mode will only be implemented if I have time). 
In the time challenge all ghost text is replaced by dots, and 
the user must type the program as fast as possible. In free mode, 
the user can edit however they want without ghost text. The AI 
assistant could switch between modes and exercises, generate 
programs with bugs, and guide the user in error messages.

Todo:
- Make "guided" mode fully functional
- Make "free mode" mode fully functional
- Make "time challenge" mode fully functional
- Research OPENAI API calls
- Add error interpretation
- If time: Make sure there are no security problems

Bugs:
- TYP-3: No memory limit cap
  - Fixing this apparently requires lots of time
- TYP-5: All forms of non-default code text changing doesn't work (restart button, changing pages)

Fixed:
- TYP-1: Copy and paste can change font + add desync
- TYP-2: No timeout or message for infinite loops
- TYP-4: Red highlight shown on free modes
