- Make sure user can switch between exercises and modes
- Make "guided" mode fully functional
- Make "free mode" mode fully functional
- Make "time challenge" mode fully functional
- Save user progress across exercises
- Research OPENAI API calls
- If time: Make sure there are no security problems

- If time: "debugging" mode fully functional

Further description:
In the debugging 
mode the user gets a similar program in which they must fix 
the error. (This mode will only be implemented if I have time). 
In the time challenge all ghost text is replaced by dots, and 
the user must type the program as fast as possible. In free mode, 
the user can edit however they want without ghost text. The AI 
assistant could switch between modes and exercises, generate 
programs with bugs, and guide the user in error messages.
